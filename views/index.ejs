            <h1>3D Printer Queue Manangement Tool For Public Makerspaces</h1>
            3DQueue is a free and open source app to help public makerspaces manage their 3D print queues, from project submissions and customer notifications to project approvals and statistics.
            <h2>Dropbox File Storage</h2>Create an account for your organization and link it to a Dropbox account to store project submission .stl files. Only .stl files can be uploaded through the project submission form. Files are automatically deleted upon either project rejection or 30 days after project completion to keep your Dropbox account tidy.
            <h2>Multitenancy Authorization</h2>Once you create a makerspace admin account, you can assign additional public-facing accounts with limited permissions. These frontline accounts can be used to submit projects but not to access other projects or manage the queue.
            <h2>Simple Customer Interface</h2>The project submission form is quick easy to fill out. The app will email customers a custom form letter to let them know when their project is available to be picked up or if their project failed to print successfully.
            <h2>Queue Management Tools</h2>Project submission form includes required fields so that incomplete project details are not submitted. Admin can check project details at a glance before approving prints to enter the queue. Once a project is approved, it will automatically enter the queue. In order to allow for equitable printer use, customers can only have a single print in the queue at a time. Additional approved projects will enter into the queue as each of the customer's previous projects is marked as completed.
            <h2>Statistics at a Glance</h2>See a variety of printer use statistics and graphs for valuable grant reporting data.
